Power BI Data Analytics Project: Cricket Best 11

Project Overview

This project aims to analyze cricket players' performances to create an optimal "Best 11" team based on data collected from various sources. The analysis includes multiple metrics such as strike rate, batting average, boundary percentage, and balls faced. The project was completed using Power BI for data visualization, after conducting web scraping and data cleaning to ensure accurate analysis.

Key Steps

Data Collection:

Data was scraped from reliable sports websites to collect player statistics.
The key data points include runs, balls faced, strike rate, batting average, and boundary percentage for each player.

Data Cleaning:

Raw data was processed to remove inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates.
The final dataset was optimized for analysis by structuring the information into categories such as Power Hitters, Anchors, Finishers, and Fast Bowlers.

Data Visualization:

The cleaned data was then visualized in Power BI Desktop.
Key metrics like Strike Rate, Batting Average, and Boundary Percentage were used to highlight each player's strengths and performance.
The visualizations include scatter plots, bar charts, and tables, allowing a comprehensive view of players' statistics.

Interactive filters were added for a user to select players and compare their performance.
